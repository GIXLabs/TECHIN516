## Lab Instructions

All lab instructions are provided as markdown files in their respective folders.

For each lab, write a lab report containing your name, the due date, and the answers to all lab questions.  
Write your lab report as a [VS Code Jupyter Notebook](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks), export it as a PDF, and submit it to the assignment page in Canvas.  
Title the notebook like: `lab1_your_name.ipynb`.  
An [example lab report is available in this repo](/lab_report_example.ipynb).

**Any lab question, and any part of provided code, may be used as a question in the weekly quizzes.**
